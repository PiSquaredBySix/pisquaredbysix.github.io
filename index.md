<title>About me</title>
</header>
Hello there and welcome to my website! I am Balaram Harsha Kallakuri and I am currently studying at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.
I pretty much love doing everything and anything and if I could be immortal, I would &mdash; but alas! However, I am perfectly aware that I am perfectly mortal and will die someday;
so it dawned on me that I have just about enough time to do just one thing properly in my life (that is if I don't sacrifice my life to save someone else's &mdash; that would be so cool), and so I chose physics &mdash; and philosophy!  

At the moment, this website only contains the link to my blog page, but in the near future, I am hoping to also document some of my coding and other projects as well.
And also &mdash; in case your eyesballs haven't burnt off already somehow &mdash; you will notice that this website (and the blog) looks very bland and worst of all &mdash; is in light mode.
I don't have enough time at the moment to properly style the website at the moment (gotta wait for winter break :) )  so you will have to forgive me for this horrible sin.


Anyway here's the website: [To Be Human](https://pisquaredbysix.github.io/to-be-human/)
